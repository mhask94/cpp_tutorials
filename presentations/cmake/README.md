# CMAKE
CMake is a tool used to organize your C++ project and link external libraries 
that you are going to use. Your project could be built from the command line 
using gcc with specified options; however, this is going to be less intuitive 
for most people. The gcc commands can be orgainzed into a Makefile, but these 
still are not going to be very readable. With CMake, you write a CMakeLists.txt 
file that is more readable than the other options. CMake has a lot of 
functionality, but for most cases it is suffiecient to be familiar with just a 
couple of the functions.
