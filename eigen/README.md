# Eigen Introduction
Eigen is a C++ header-only library that provides matrix and vector 
functionality. It is basically the Numpy of C++. Eigen is written to be 
lightweight, fast, and efficient. Their 
[documentation](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/) is really good, so please 
refer to it for everything that isn't covered here. These items will be covered 
here:

  1. [Basic Syntax](#basic-syntax)
  2. [Initialization](#initialization)
  3. [Accessing Elements](#accessing-elements)
  4. [Matrix Operations](#matrix-operations)
