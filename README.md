# C++ Tutorials
This repository was created to help BYU students that are beggining to dive 
into programming deeper than is taught in the ME curriculum (maybe others 
as well). It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with basic data 
types, loops (do, while, if, for), and functions.

Feel free to report any issues you might find or provide suggestions to make 
this repository more useful! :)

## Navigation
See individual directories for presentations on that topic. Each directory 
should have a README file that contains the presentation; these should display 
automatically when accessed through your browser. Some of the directories 
contain example code files to try and create an interactive process.
